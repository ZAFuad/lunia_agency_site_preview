    desc:`Conducting an SEO audit of your website is one of the most important advanced SEO techniques you can apply. Doing so will provide you with a wealth of useful information about how your site is performing. First, quickly take stock of all the pieces of your SEO puzzle. SEMRush provides a handy SEO checklist you can use. Figure out what pieces you have in place, and what steps you still need to take to get your site on the right track. For example, is your off-page SEO on point? What about your on-page optimization? From there, it’s time to start auditing. An SEO audit will give you a big-picture view of how well you’re optimizing your website. Among other things, your audit will help you uncover issues relating to how Google may or may not be indexing your site. We’ve written a full guide for conducting a site audit to help. Don’t neglect third-party website auditing tools, as well. There are some great free SEO tools you can use in addition to any SEO auditing you do on your own, and there are some great SEO plugins for WordPress that can help fix any problems that these auditing tools find.`
